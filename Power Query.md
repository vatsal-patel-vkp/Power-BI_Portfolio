# Power Query Project: Retail Stores Pricing Strategy Analysis


## Overview

The Apocalypse Food Prep - Power Query project focuses on analyzing and comparing the pricing strategies of three major retail stores: Walmart, Target, and Costco. 
The project utilizes Power Query, a powerful data transformation tool within Power BI, to gather, clean, and integrate the pricing data from the different retailers. 
By conducting an in-depth analysis, the project aims to provide valuable insights into how each store positions its products, handles pricing variations, and attracts 
customers based on their pricing strategies.


## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of product pricing information from Walmart, Target, and Costco. It includes attributes such as product names, categories, 
brands, unit prices, special offers (e.g., discounts, promotions), and other relevant details. The data can be obtained through web scraping, APIs, or direct 
partnerships with the respective retail stores.


## Project Objectives

Data Collection and Integration: Use Power Query to gather data from Walmart, Target, and Costco, and transform it into a unified format for seamless analysis.
